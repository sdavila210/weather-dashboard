# weather-dashboard
A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS using a server-side API.

## Description

This is a webpage that was created using Javascript and server-side APIs to create a a weather dashboard. It retrieves data from openweathermap.org in order to display the information for the current weather for cities that the user searches.

## Installation

## Usage

To use this webpage, the user can type in the name of a city in the United States, and click the search button. The results of the current weather and a 5-day forecast will display. It will have the location, temperature, wind speed, humidity percentage, and an icon of the weather. When the user types in a city name, that city will be saved in the search history as a clickable button that will retrieve the weather information again.
